# Attribute Type Qualifiers

- `uniform`: constant accross the face
- `smooth`: perspective-correct interpolation
- `noperspective`: linear interpolation (Barycentric coordinates)

**Unimplemented**: flat ("provoking" vertex), closest (would-be-nice)

# Concise Description of Coordinate Systems

## World Coordinates

"Bake" all modeling transformations. Simple.

## Camera Coordinates

Change of coordinates so that -w is camera gaze. Simple

## Normalized Device Coordinates

Map the space inside camera frustum to $ [-1,1] ^ 3 $

### Notes
- Z-values here will get mapped into Z-buffer element range $ [0,1] $.
- **IS** used for clipping.
- **IS NOT** the input to rasterizer, technically.

## Viewport Coordinates

Transform all point in Canonical Viewing Volume to an image plane of size `image_width * image_height`
that is actually *slightly shifted* towards $ (-0.5,-0.5) $ so that 
**integer coordinates are the center of a pixel sample**.

Original $Z$ values are not touched! It is still in range $[-1,1]$, unlike $X$ and $Y$.

## Notes
- **IS NOT** used for clipping. The code for clipping should reside in Renderer!
- Viewport Coordinates are floating-point!
- Sooner or later coordinates need to be "dehomogenized"
- Points here are fed to rasterized to obtain integer-aligned *fragments*

# Exhaustive "Product Story"

## Step 0: World (input)

### Input

A scene in some format.

### Processing

"Bake" the scene.

### Output
- Every object is composed of `Face`, though objects themselves are not exposed to outside, so a `std::vector<Face>` may as well be the input world object. Every `Face` contains `Vertex`. Both have an associated *attribute* object.


     + *Attributes*: Vertices and Faces may have attributes that need to be passed down to its resultant Fragments. Vertices have `ceng477_color`. Faces may have an associated material.

## Step 1: Camera (`t_camera`, Back-face culling)

### Input

- A single `Face`

### Processing

- Calculate camera coordinates of vertices. Simple
- Find Surface Normals. Take normal and gaze. Perform BFC

### Output

- Either a `Face` or nothing.

## Step 2: Device + Viewport Transform (`t_projection`, Clipping, `t_viewport`)

### Input

- A single `Face`

### Processing

- 3 matrix multiplications. Simple.
- The resultant transformed `Face` needs to be clipped (WIP)
- `t_viewport` multiplications for each vertex of this weird shape we got. Simple!

### Output

- A weird shape, with vertices in Viewport Coordinates (WIP)

## Step 3: Rasterizer (Line Drawing, Solid Drawing, Attribute Interpolation)

### Input

- A weird shape, with vertices in Viewport Coordinates (WIP)

### Processing

### Output

- A `Fragment`, that has integer Pixel Coordinates in **conventional 2D directions**
where $Y$ becomes larger as we go *down*.

## Step 4: Fragment Processing (Depth Test)

### Input

- *All* of the resultant many a `Fragment`.

### Processing

- Initialize Z-buffer and perform Depth Test by iterating through all Fragments

### Output

- *Some* of the resultant many a `Fragment`.



## Step 5: Write to Image

*Self-explanatory*

# TODO

- Re-organize Renderer to reflect these steps.
- Tweak Rasterizer interface
- New data-structure to hold the "weird shape"
- Midpoint Algorithm
- Filling in shapes
- Clearly mark where all the "dehomogenization" happens.
